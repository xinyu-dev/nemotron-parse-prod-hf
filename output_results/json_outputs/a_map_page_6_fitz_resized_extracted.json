Not all of the networks consisted of exactly three patches; for example, the stubby and NML networks each contained four patches (Fig. 4d, see Supplementary Information), and previous work has suggested that there are six face patches in each hemisphere, with some individual variability<sup>20</sup>. Thus, IT cortex may contain additional repetitions of die object space map. Furthermore, we emphasize that our study addresses IT organization at a coarse spatial scale and does not exclude the possibility of additional organization at finer spatial scales (Extended Data Fig. 8; see Supplementary Information). Recordings from multiple grid holes suggest that each patch spans 3\u20134 mm (Extended Data Fig. 8a\u2013d). Although we failed to find clustering at finer scales within a patch (Extended Data Fig. 8e, f) or clustering for any dimensions beyond the first two (Extended Data Fig. 8g, h), it is possible that mapping techniques with higher spatial resolution may reveal additional substructure within patches."
