However, these networks comprise only part of IT, and much of IT is not differentially activated by any known stimulus comparison. Here we investigate whether this \u2018unexplained\u2019 IT shows any functional specialization. Furthermore, beyond simply parcelling IT, we investigate whether there is an overarching general principle governing the anatomical layout of IT cortex."

Early studies using electrophysiology in monkeys suggested a columnar architecture for visual shape<sup>12</sup>, but the small field-of-view of electrophysiology precluded understanding the larger-scale organization of these columns. Later studies, using functional MRI (fMRI) in humans, proposed various schemes to explain large-scale IT organization including retinotopy<sup>13</sup> and real-world size<sup>14</sup>, but these proposals did not provide a complete account of IT organization and lacked ground-truth validation at the level of single units. Here, we combined fMRI, electrical microstimulation, and electrophysiology in the same animals to investigate the organization of macaque IT at multiple scales, and found that a large portion of macaque IT cortex is topographically organized into a map of object space that is repeated three times."

However, lacking any good guesses, we decided to approach the problem from an anatomical perspective. We ran a large set of stimulus comparisons to localize face, body, scene, colour, and disparity patches in a specific monkey (Ml) and thereby define the \u2018no man\u2019s land\u2019 of IT cortex in this monkey: regions that were not identified by any known localizer (Fig. 1a, b). We then electrically microstimulated a random site within this no man\u2019s land in central IT cortex<sup>15</sup>. This experiment revealed that the stimulated region (NML2) was connected to two other, discrete regions in IT (NML1, NML3) (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 1), forming a previously unknown anatomical network within no man\u2019s land."
