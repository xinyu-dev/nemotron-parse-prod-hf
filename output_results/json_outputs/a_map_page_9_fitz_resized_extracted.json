The localizer contained three types of block. Block 1 contained images of the five most-preferred objects each at eight views (0\u00b0 rotation in the y-z space, first row in Extended Data Fig. 2b). Block 2 contained images of the five least-preferred objects each at eight views. Block 3 contained images of five objects that belonged to the animal category each at eight views. A block containing phase-scrambled noise patterns preceded each stimulus block (using the images shown in blocks 1\u20133). To construct phase-scrambled images, we performed fast Fourier transform (FFT) on images, added a random phase to each frequency component, and then performed an inverse FFT. During the fMRI experiment, stimuli were presented in 24-s blocks at an interstimulus interval of 500 ms. In each scan, the order of the stimulus blocks was fixed as follows: preferred objects, non- preferred objects, animals, non-preferred objects, animals, preferred objects, animals, preferred objects, non-preferred objects. In addition, a block containing phase-scrambled noise was added at the end of each scan. Each scan lasted 456 s. Four monkeys were tested with this localizer, and 6\u20139 scans were performed for each monkey."

Then 20 different images were selected from each of the four quadrants of object PC1\u2013PC2 space, each with a polar angle roughly centred on the respective quadrant. The images were presented in 24-s blocks at an interstimulus interval of 500 ms. In each run, the four blocks were each presented twice, interleaved with phasecrambled noise patterns (computed using images from the four object blocks).
