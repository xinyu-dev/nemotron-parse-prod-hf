On average, each cell was significantly\ntuned to seven dimensions. Notably, the preferred axis of each cell was stable to the precise\nimage set (Extended Data Fig. 5a). The 50D linear object space model could explain 44.7%\nvariance, or 53.3% of the explainable variance of NML neurons on average (Extended Data\nFig. 5b); this is significantly higher than a Gaussian model and similar to a quadratic model\n(Extended Data Fig. 5c, d). Consistent with the high explained variance by the linear model,\ncell tuning along the preferred axis in the 50D object space was ramp-shaped (Fig. 3c, top).\nSimilar ramp-shaped tuning has previously been reported for face-selective cells<sup>18</sup>. NML\nneurons also showed approximately flat tuning along orthogonal axes (Extended Data Fig.\n5e), another property that has been previously observed in face-selective cells<sup>18</sup>. Together,\nramp-shaped tuning along the preferred axis and flat tuning along orthogonal axes implies\nthat cells in the NML network are linearly projecting incoming objects, formatted as vectors\nin object space, onto specific preferred axes."

The NML network consists of connected patches, cells within the\nnetwork show a consistent pattern of selectivity, there is increasing view invariance along the\nnetwork, and finally, single cells in the network represent object identity through an axis\ncode. Thus there seems to be a clear structural parallel between the face network and the\nNML network. We therefore investigated whether additional networks in IT cortex follow\nthe same scheme."

Population similarity matrices showed increased view invariance in the\nmost anterior body patch (Fig. 3a, b (middle), Extended Data Fig. 3e, f), consistent with a\nprevious study<sup>19</sup>.

Recall that the first two axes of object space are roughly stubby\nversus spiky, and animate versus inanimate (Extended Data Fig. 4b). We noticed a\nremarkable relationship between these two axes and the selectivity of the NML, body, and\nface networks. Face patches prefer stubby animate objects; body patches prefer spiky,\nanimate objects; and NML patches prefer spiky objects regardless of animacy (Fig. 2a).\nThese observations made us wonder whether all of IT might be topographically organized\naccording to the first two dimensions of object space (Fig. 4a), in the same way that\nretinotopic cortex is organized according to polar angle and eccentricity."
