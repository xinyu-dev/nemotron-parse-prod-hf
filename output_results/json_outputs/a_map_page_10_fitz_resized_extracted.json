The images were selected from an image set containing 19,300 background-free object images (images from http://www.freepngs.com). The images were first binarized by setting any pixel that belonged to the object to 0 and any pixel that did not belong to the object to 1. Images were then passed through AlexNet and projected to object PC1\u2013PC2 space built using the original 1,224 images (see \u2018Building an object space using a deep network\u2019). Then, 20 different images were selected from each of the four quadrants of object PC1\u2013PC2 space. The images were presented in 24-s blocks at an interstimulus interval of 500 ms. In each run, the four blocks were each presented twice, interleaved with blocks only showing a background with fixation point. A block containing a background with fixation point was added at the end of each scan. Each scan lasted 408 s. Three monkeys were tested with this localizer, and 12\u201324 scans were performed for each monkey."
