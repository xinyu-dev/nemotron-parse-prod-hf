Different colors encode neurons from different networks. g2. Same as (g1), but the color represents the cluster that the neuron belongs to. Clusters were determined by k-means analysis, with number of clusters set to 4, and distance between neurons defined by the correlation between preferred axes in the 50-d object space (see Methods). Comparison of (g1) and (g2) reveals highly similarity between the anatomical clustering of IT networks and the functional clustering determined by k-means analysis. g3. Calinski-Harabasz criterion values were plotted against the number of clusters for k-means analysis performed with different number of clusters (see Methods). The optimal cluster number is 4. h1. Same as (g1) for projection of preferred axes onto PC3 versus PC4. (h2) Same as (h1), but the color represents the cluster that the neurons belongs to. Clusters were determined by k-means analysis, with number of clusters set to 4, and distance between neurons defined by the correlation between preferred axes in the 48-d object space obtained by removing the first two dimensions. The difference between (h1) and (h2) suggests there is no anatomical clustering for dimensions beyond the first two PCs. (h3) Same as (g3), with k-means analysis in the 48-d object space. By the Calinski-Harabasz criterion, there is no functional clustering for higher dimensions beyond the first two."
