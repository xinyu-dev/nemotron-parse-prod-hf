Previously, it was thought that the face system, with its striking clustering of face-selective cells, was a unique evolutionary consequence of the importance of face recognition to primate social behaviour. Here we show that the face system arises naturally from the statistical structure of object space. One prediction is that face-deprived animals should still show a network specialized for round objects (for example, clocks, apples), even if it is not specialized for faces per se. Selectivity for additional features may develop with face experience<sup>26</sup>."

Additional new predictions are that lesions in any part of IT should lead to agnosias in specific sectors of object space<sup>29</sup>, and that other brain regions that contain face patches may also harbour maps of object space<sup>30</sup>. Finally, it will be important to discover whether remaining unaccounted-for regions of IT can be explained within the same general framework of a map of object space."

The images at 24 views for each object were generated using 3dMax (Autodesk) software. Each image was presented for 250 ms interleaved with 150 ms of a grey screen. Each image was presented 4\u20138 times. 2) A set of line segments that varied along three dimensions: curvature, aspect ratio, and orientation (Extended Data Fig. 2c). Each image was presented for 150 ms interleaved with 150 ms of a grey screen. Each image was presented 6\u20138 times. 3) A set of object images consisting of 1,392 different images downloaded from www.fireepngs.com.
