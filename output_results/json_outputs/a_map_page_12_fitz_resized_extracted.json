During microstimulation blocks we applied one pulse train per second, lasting 200 ms with a pulse frequency of 300 Hz. Bipolar current pulses were charge balanced, with a phase duration of 300 \u03bcs and a distance between the two phases of 150 \u03bcs. We used a current amplitude of 300 \u03bcA. Stimulation pulses were delivered using a computer-triggered pulse generator (S88X; Grass Technologies) connected to a stimulus isolator (A365, World Precision Instruments). All stimulus generation equipment was stored in the scanner control room; the coaxial cable was passed through a wave guide into the scanner room. We obtained 30 scans for monkey M1."

The guide tube length was set to reach approximately 3\u20135 mm below the dura surface. The electrode was advanced slowly using a manual advancer (Narishige Scientific Instrument, Tokyo, Japan). Neural signals were amplified and extracellular action potentials were isolated using the box method in an on-line spike sorting system (Plexon, Dallas, TX, USA). Spikes were sampled at 40 kHz. All spike data were re-sorted using off-line spike sorting clustering algorithms (Plexon). We recorded data from every neuron encountered. Only well-isolated units were considered for further analysis; otherwise, every neuron was included for analysis. Electrodes were lowered through custom angled grids that allowed us to reach the desired targets; custom software was used to design the grids and plan the electrode trajectories<sup>38</sup>."
